HUMAN SOLVE:

fill domains
anchor domains around Os
 - bridge? will get caught the next time fill domains runs
add Xs to portions with no active domains
constrain domain within Xs
 - includes "finding the only place within the domain where it can fit now"
repeat


example: we have a few domains in a line: (0,2) (3,7) (5, 10)
~~~~~~~
code:
if we're executing this for a line, it's because there's a new tile in there
so we marked this line for sweeping.

right now sweep the whole line, but maybe in future we could optimize
to mark the specific new tile(s) instead of the line and look at their domains.

as we sweep if we find a tile:
  if it's the first or last place a tile can go
  or
  if the domain it's in doesn't overlap with any other domains,
    we know that tile's owner block
    and
    we can cut that blocks domain to blocklen/2 away from that tile.

    cutting domain seems like a pretty safe operation,
    because we'll never lose the end of a block as long as our logic is right.

this might be a good time to "bridge" within solved domain portions

when two tiles are marked with space between them and they're in a singular
portion of one domain, we can "bridge"/mark all the tiles between them
